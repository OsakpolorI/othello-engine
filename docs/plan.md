# Project Plan

## `Todo`
- ~~Unpopulate java doc in strategy classes~~
- ~~Change name of files to be cleaner~~
- ~~Practice/ go through a clean iteration of the game (in java terminal),~~
- ~~making sure that each strategy works and each method/action is abstract enough~~
- ~~so that api can be cleanly implemented~~


- plan out / revise api endpoints
- install springboot/dependencies
- create controllers and service layers that connect to the game engine
