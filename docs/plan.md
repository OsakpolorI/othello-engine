# Project Plan

## `Todo`
- Unpopulate java doc in strategy classes
- Change name of files to be cleaner
- Practice/ go through a clean iteration of the game (in java terminal),
- making sure that each strategy works and each method/action is abstract enough
- so that api can be cleanly implemented
-
